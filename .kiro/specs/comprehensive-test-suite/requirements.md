# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a comprehensive test suite that validates the core integration functionality of the Transformer library's code transformation interface. The test suite will verify that the main API works correctly with actual transformations, test both transformation strategies (random and bug-guided), and provide a streamlined guide for JAR compilation and usage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Transformer library, I want to verify that specific transformation methods work correctly, so that I can trust the library's core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a specific transformation is applied to Java source code THEN the system SHALL produce syntactically correct transformed code
2. WHEN testing AddBrackets transformation THEN the system SHALL add brackets to control structures where they are missing
3. WHEN testing LoopConversion transformation THEN the system SHALL convert between different loop types while preserving semantics
4. IF the input code is invalid THEN the system SHALL throw appropriate ParseException
5. WHEN transformation is successful THEN the system SHALL return a TransformationResult with success status and transformed code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher testing static analysis tools, I want to validate both transformation strategies work correctly, so that I can choose the appropriate strategy for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using RandomLocationStrategy THEN the system SHALL select transformation locations randomly from available candidates
2. WHEN using GuidedLocationStrategy with bug information THEN the system SHALL prioritize transformation locations based on provided bug data
3. WHEN no bug information is provided to GuidedLocationStrategy THEN the system SHALL fall back to random selection
4. WHEN applying transformations with either strategy THEN the system SHALL produce semantically equivalent code
5. IF strategy execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the failure reason

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new user of the Transformer library, I want a streamlined guide for JAR compilation and usage, so that I can quickly get started with the library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN following the compilation guide THEN the user SHALL be able to build a JAR with all dependencies
2. WHEN using the JAR THEN the user SHALL be able to execute transformations via command line
3. WHEN running the JAR without parameters THEN the system SHALL display usage instructions
4. WHEN providing invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages and usage examples
5. IF Maven is not available THEN the guide SHALL provide alternative build instructions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want integration tests that verify the complete transformation workflow, so that I can ensure the library works end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL test the complete workflow from input to output
2. WHEN testing with sample Java files THEN the system SHALL successfully transform and validate the results
3. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful feedback
4. WHEN running all tests THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (under 30 seconds)
5. IF any integration test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information for debugging
